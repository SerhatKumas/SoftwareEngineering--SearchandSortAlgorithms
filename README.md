# SoftwareEngineering--SearchandSortAlgorithms
- This project has been created while practising the search and sort algorithms.
  
- Main folder has Algorithms.pdf that explains what algorithm is and its types.

- Every folder of the search and sort algorithms cointain 2 folders which are documentation and Implementation_Java folders.
  
- Documentation folders contain pdf created by taking notes while studying that algorithm. In short, pdfs explain the algorithm basics.

- Some of the documentation folders also have images and some other supportive documentation.

- Implementation_Java folder contains implementation of that algorithms in Java.

- In implementations, my main purpose was to practise and understand the logic of the algorithms, I was not concerned about best practise design patterns, efficiency and complexity matters.

## Visualization Tools
- https://visualgo.net/en -> Various data structures and algorithms visualization tool, it was beneficial to understand how they work.
  
- https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms -> Run time comparing for different variations visualization


## Technologies
- Implementations are done in [@Java](https://www.oracle.com/tr/java/technologies/downloads/) while practising.


## References

- All the references used in the projecs are given in pdf files under Documentation folders.
